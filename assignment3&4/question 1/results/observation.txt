This code generates a text-based dashboard by retrieving or using example data. Information such as the nation, city, currency, and threat score (if accessible) are extracted. For readability, the data is provided with distinct labels and separators. Using an external library, you can optionally add a chart for the threat score (installation required). Recall to modify the code for your data structure and swap out the placeholder API key.
